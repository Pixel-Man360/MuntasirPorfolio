                        <ul>
                            <p> 🚀 This was a three man operation. Other than myself there was another programmer and 2 artists. I did the development part of the project solo.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p><b>🎯 My Goal for this Project</b> 
                            <br> 
                                <p>My goal was to create a Sheep farm management game with engaging systems such as player interactions, AI-driven helpers and sheeps, and monetization features, while also learning how to design scalable gameplay systems that balance performance and player experience.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p><b>✅ How I Achieved It</b></p>

                                            <ul>
                                                <li> Designed Joystick based top-down all directional movement system.</li>
                                                <li> Player can interact with the world using different triggers and colliders.</li>
                                                <li> Player can pick up items or sheeps, drop items or sheeps, and interact with buildings. Made a custom bezier curve system for the collection and dropping arc.</li>
                                                <li> Player has a limited but upgradable number of stack capacity and movement speed.</li>
                                                <li> The main goal for the player is to grow his sheep farm.</li>
                                            </ul> 
                                            
                                        <li><b>Building System- </b>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li> Build a modular Building system with unlock and upgrade with cash. Only the restaurants buildings can be upgraded to increase seating area. Player and npc upgrade building will unlock automatically.</li>
                                                <li> Some buildings have special behaviors such as wool cutting simulation or breeding simulation.</li>
                                                <li> Restaurants have a service npc inside that will serve the produced foods. Each ingrident dropped into the building will produce a specific number of food.</li>
                                                <li> Each building has different production time and will produce specific items or cash when specific item or sheep is given. </li>
                                                <li> There is an upgrade buiding for the player to upgrade character stats, hire npc helpers and upgrade their stats too.</li>
                                                <li> Made the item dropping and collecting system using triggers and coroutines. This method made it more performant as there were very few update loops.</li>
                                                <li> Used Unity's scriptable objects to create all the building data.</li>

                                                    <li> Each mission gives some rewards to the player and completing one or more missions will make the player be able to unlock the next building or next task.</li>
                                                    <li> Daily and side missions where planned but were never executed further.</li>
                                                    <li> Used Unity's scriptable object to keep track of each mission and it's next mission. The progress tracked using events and then saved and loaded using mission Id and the save load manager.</li>
                                                </ul>

                                                <li> During the wandering state the npc will check if there are any buildings that has produced items and pick one randomly (This was handled using a list inside the world manager. 
                                                     everytime a building produced something it will go into the list and once everything is collected it will come out of the list).</li>

                         📚 What I Learned
                            <ul>
                                <li> <b>Refining AI Design:</b> Having already built FSMs in Idle Power City, I went deeper into priority-based task management and AI interactions that felt more natural and player-supportive.</li>
                                <li> <b>Optimization Beyond Basics:</b> Instead of just making systems work, I focused on performance optimization techniques like minimizing Update calls, leveraging triggers, and improving coroutine usage.</li>
                                <li> <b>Player-Centric Design:</b> Learned how to balance helper NPC behaviors so they supported the player instead of competing with them, improving the game’s usability and flow.</li>
                                <li> <b>System Modularity:</b> Improved at making gameplay systems more data-driven and reusable by leaning further into Scriptable Objects and event-driven design patterns.</li>
                                <li> <b>Experience as Sole Developer:</b> Learned how to handle the entire development workload alone, from gameplay to UI to monetization, while keeping the project cohesive and polished.</li>
