                    <div class="project-contributions__text">
                        <ul>
                            <p> 🚀 This was a four man operation. Other than myself there was another programmer and 2 artists. I started with the player behavior while the other programmer started with the enemy behavior. The artists were responsible for modelling the characters, weapons and turrets. This was our biggest and longest project to date. 
                                It had a lot of iterations and many changes throughout development. But the core gameplay and idea stayed as it is. Just the game design and art and vfx changed from time to time.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p><b>🎯 My Goal for this Project</b> 
                            <br>
                            <p>My goal was to develop a large-scale, feature-rich mobile action game that combined real-time combat, deep progression systems, and monetization features. 
                                I was put into this project to grow beyond smaller prototypes and learn how to design modular systems that could scale across dozens of features while still feeling cohesive. 
                                Another key goal was to refine my skills in gameplay systems and UI/UX design, since this project required one of the most advanced systems and also the most comprehensive and player-friendly interfaces I had built so far.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p><b>✅ How I Achieved It</b></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Core Gameplay Systems:-</b>
                                    <ul> 
                                        <li><b>Base Player Behavior- </b>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li> Implemented Joystick based semi top-down all directional movement system.</li>
                                                <li> Player can interact with the world using different triggers and colliders.</li>
                                                <li> The collection and dropping of the tokens by the player were implemented with a custom bezier curve system for smooth animations and performance (Used coroutines).</li>
                                            </ul> 
                                            </li>

                                            <li><b>Toxic area system- </b>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li> Each area of a world is separated by a safe zone and a toxic zone. Safe zones are where players can place turrets and heal themselves. The first area is always safe. </li>
                                                <li> We can start the fight when the player enters the fight area and the wave starts.</li>
                                                <li> Implemented a system where player takes damage over time when entering a toxic area. Players will get an 8 seconds force field for safety. After that they will take damage quickly.</li>
                                                <li> Implemented a generator system as a temporary safe zone that players can activate using Radiation Tokens to heal themselves and stop the toxic damage.</li>
                                            </ul> 
                                            </li>

                                                <li> Players can choose from a pool of 4 champions to play with.</li>
                                                <li> Each champion are available after finishing a world and/or area. After that players need to unlock them with Gems or Ads. The first champion <b>Master Rick</b> is unlocked by default.</li>
                                                <li> Each champion has distinct abilities and playstyles, encouraging diverse strategies.</li>
                                                <li> Players can level up their champions through player fragments and coins gained from battle rewards, chests and shop.</li>
                                                <li> Each champion has a special ability called Frenzy mode which triggers after killing a certain number of enemies. During frenzy mode each champion uses their own unique special skills. 
                                                    I didn't implement their behaviors but I added the VFX and SFX for champion abilities to enhance gameplay immersion</li>
                                            </ul>

                                                <li> There are 4 different ranks for each weapon which are common (Blue), Rare (Green), Epic (Orange), Legendary (Red), each increasing the level cap.</li>
                                                <li> Players can upgrade weapons using coins and rank up weapons using weapon fragments gained from battle rewards, chests and shop.</li>

                                                <li> Each skin has its own VFX and animations. </li>
                                                <li> Added VFX and SFX for upgrading and rank up for each gun and also added UI and VFX to show each rank.</li>
                                                <li> I didn't implement the shooting system but I added the VFX and SFX for shooting, hitting and damage number and also designed different projectiles and audio for different guns.</li>
                                            </ul>

                            <li><b>Progression & Live-Ops Design:</b> Gained deep experience in creating player progression loops (missions, upgrades, chests, login rewards, ads) and balancing them for engagement and monetization.</li>
                            <li><b>UI/UX Mastery:</b>This project pushed my UI design skills to their best yet — I learned to design complex menu flows and views, modular reward timers, mission interfaces, popups, and shops while ensuring clarity and ease of use.</li>
                            <li><b>Iteration & Adaptability:</b>Since this was a long-running project with way too many design/art overhauls, I learned how to adapt systems flexibly without breaking core mechanics.</li>
