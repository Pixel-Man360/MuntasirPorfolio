                        <ul>
                            <li><p> 🚀 This was a four man operation. Other than myself there was another programmer and 2 artists. I started with the player behavior while the other programmer started with the enemy behavior. The artists were responsible for modelling the characters, weapons and turrets. This was our biggest and longest project to date. 
                                It had a lot of iterations and many changes throughout development. But the core gameplay and idea stayed as it is. Just the game design and art and vfx changed from time to time.</p></li>
