                        <ul>
                            <li><p> 🚀 This was a four man operation. Other than myself there was another programmer and 2 artists. I started with the player behavior while the other programmer started with the enemy behavior. The artists were responsible for modelling the characters, weapons and turrets. This was our biggest and longest project to date. 
                                It had a lot of iterations and many changes throughout development. But the core gameplay and idea stayed as it is. Just the game design and art and vfx changed from time to time.</p></li>
                            
                            <li><b>I implemented:</b></li>

                                                <li> Joystick based semi top-down all directional movement system.</li>
                                                <li> Player can interact with the world using different triggers and colliders.</li>
                                                <li> Player auto targetting and shooting was implemented using a sphere collider trigger for performance and simplicity.</li>
                                                <li> There was an internal capsule collider for the player which was used for interactions with the turret unlock or upgrade zones, attacks zones and enemies.</li>
                                                <li> The in game resource for unlocking and upgrading the turrets was radiation token (Green). I made a system where the current area will start with a fixed amount of tokens and enemies would drop a certain amount of radiation tokens.</li>
                                                <li> The collection and dropping of the tokens by the player were implemented with a custom bezier curve system for smooth animations and performance (Used coroutines).</li>
