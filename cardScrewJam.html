                                                <li> The cards are sorted by colors and elements. Each card will have a different color and sometimes a color and an element.</li>

                                                <li> If the color of the card doesn't match the box, it will go on to the temporary slot.</li>

                                                <li> If a box is filled, another box of a different color will come forward. If the temporary slots have any card of the same color and/or element, it gets filled immediately.</li>

                                                <li> This gameplay system was created using Unity Hinge joint. I connected the cards and pins using hinge joints to allow for smooth movement and interaction. Turning of a joint makes the card rotate and fall.</li>

                                                <li> The level design was a repeatative process. To save time I made 2 different editor tools. </li>
                                                <li> The first tool was responsible for setting up the hinge joints, rigidbodies and colliders for each card and pin. This made connecting a card to a pin or another card easier.</li>
                                                <li> The second tool was responsible for setting up the visual layers for each of the 2d cards (as some cards had to stay on top of others).</li>
                                                <li> I used Unity's scriptable object system for the level data such as number of briefcase, what type and color of cards each briefcase slot contained and whether or not it's a harder level.</li>

                                            <li> The spin wheel was created to give players some powerups or coins as reward.</li>
                                            <li> The wheel was created using Unity's UI system. The spinning effect was done using dotween. I divided the wheel into 8 sections and each section had a different reward.</li>
                                            <li> When the spin button is pressed, a section is randomly chosen. Then I calculated the number of rotation required to get to a slot by using 360 / slotCount formula. Then I just added some offset for the spin count and that acted as the duration.</li>
                                            <li> The spinning ease out was done using dotween.</li>
                                            <li> I modified the sfx for the spin using Audacity and made it as long as the spin duration.  </li>
