                            <p>🚀 I was the sole programmer/developer for this game. I worked with our 2d artist and led the project.</p>

                            <p>My goal was to design and implement a physics-based puzzle game with unique card gameplay using the trendy pin and match 3 mechanics.</p>

                                                <li> Pin will only be screwed if the slot has no overlap.</li>

                                                <li> Unscrewed cards will fall down and moved to a card slot on top.</li>
                                                <li> The cards are sorted by colors and elements. Each card will have a different color and sometimes a color and an element.</li>
                                                <li> These cards are needed to be placed onto the box on top of the gameplay. Each box has a specific color and three empty slots inside. The cards are needed to be placed my color and element inside the slots. </li>
                                                <li> If the color of the card doesn't match the box, it will go on to the temporary slot.</li>
                                                <li> If all the temporary slots are filled, that level is lost.</li>
                                                <li> If a box is filled, another box of a different color will come forward. If the temporary slots have any card of the same color and/or element, it gets filled immediately.</li>
                                                <li> The cards will be sorted by color into the temporary card slots.</li>
                                                <li> This gameplay system was created using Unity Hinge joint. I connected the cards and pins using hinge joints to allow for smooth movement and interaction. Turning of a joint makes the card rotate and fall.</li>

                                            </ul>

                                                <li>This was done by having a predefined hidden pin which was activated when the powerup was clicked.</li>

                                                <li> The level design was a repeatative process. To save time I made 2 different editor tools. </li>
                                                <li> The first tool was responsible for setting up the hinge joints, rigidbodies and colliders for each card and pin. This made connecting a card to a pin or another card easier.</li>
                                                <li> The second tool was responsible for setting up the visual layers for each of the 2d cards (as some cards had to stay on top of others).</li>
                                                <li> I used Unity's scriptable object system for the level data such as number of briefcase, what type and color of cards each briefcase slot contained and whether or not it's a harder level.</li>

                                            </ul>

                                                <li> The level scroller was created using sliders and some calculations to determine the spacing between each level.</li>
                                                <li> Hard levels had different graphics to indicate their difficulty.</li>

                                        <ul>
                                            <li> The spin wheel was created to give players some powerups or coins as reward.</li>
                                            <li> The wheel was created using Unity's UI system. The spinning effect was done using dotween. I divided the wheel into 8 sections and each section had a different reward.</li>
                                            <li> When the spin button is pressed, a section is randomly chosen. Then I calculated the number of rotation required to get to a slot by using 360 / slotCount formula. Then I just added some offset for the spin count and that acted as the duration.</li>
                                            <li> The spinning ease out was done using dotween.</li>
                                            <li> I modified the sfx for the spin using Audacity and made it as long as the spin duration.  </li>
                                        </ul> 
                                    </ul>

                        <li><b>Physics-Based Gameplay:</b> Learned how to creatively use Unity Hinge Joints and Rigidbody interactions to make smooth, intuitive puzzle mechanics.</li>
                        <li><b>Editor Productivity:</b> Built my third custom Unity editor tool to automate repetitive level setup, saving massive time and ensuring consistency.</li>
                        <li><b>Systematic Level Design:</b> Learned how to represent puzzle levels in a data-driven way (via Scriptable Objects) so designers could easily create and iterate on new challenges.</li>
                        <li><b>Player Engagement Loops:</b> Gained experience designing reward systems (spin wheel, powerups) to increase session retention and gameplay variety.</li>
                        <li><b>Polish & Feedback:</b> Improved at handling animations, sound, and feedback systems to make puzzle interactions feel more tactile and satisfying.</li>
                        <li><b>Full Ownership:</b> Strengthened my ability to handle end-to-end development alone, including gameplay, tools, UI, and audio integration.</li>
